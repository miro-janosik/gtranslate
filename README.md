# gtranslate

Testing the google translate functionality.

Running it on a pack of segmented lab files, where each segment of the file may be of different language.
Goal is to split the segment info, translate, and put it back together translated into paired file.

All in python.
Testing on a demo account to see how much it costs to translate, I estimate that the 150$ credit could be worth a million words.
